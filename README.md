### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 16-year-old programmer from Russia, trying to learn and do cool stuff against all odds.

My stack:
* Python
    - fastapi
    - vkbottle
    - telethon
    - asyncio
* Rust (language only)
* C (language only)
* Go (aka Golang; language only)
* Git
* SQL (base language + window functions concept from PostgreSQL)
* JavaScript (without frameworks! (But I can do browser and page interactions using JavaScript))

## My best projects

* [BAC_light](https://github.com/megahomyak/BAC_light) - bot for VKontakte, which helped us to automate some work in our school company (actually, we were just a bunch of friends doing this mostly for fun, but it ended up being something more than a joke). Sadly, I disabled it, because it wasn't needed anymore and my personal server was running out of RAM. Definitely overcomplicated.
* [timetable_getter_bot](https://github.com/megahomyak/timetable_getter_bot) - another bot for VKontakte, which helps us at school to get fresh timetables with notifications. The problem was that the timetables were posted only on our educational platform, and to get new timetable, you would need to log in, check recent announcements, and hope that the new timetable is here. This bot automates that process and sends timetables to a VK group and the specified chats.
* [simple_avk](https://github.com/megahomyak/simple_avk) - really robust library, which allows you to interact with VK API. It was my practice at asyncio, and also it was created with an intent to get rid of any VK errors like nightly server reboot and the following disconnection, sometimes getting HTML pages through longpoll and more strange/dumb bugs/features that VK longpoll provides.
* [sql_mapper](https://github.com/megahomyak/sql_mapper) - just maps rows received from the database connector to models. Oh, and it also can create tables using the model. That's it, probably.
* [cards_generator](https://github.com/megahomyak/cards_generator) - generates cards with given text from a given image.

## My educational projects

* [tiny_event_loop](https://github.com/megahomyak/tiny_event_loop) - that's just me practicing writing an event loop by myself. Well, at least it works as intended.
* [sql_join_explanation](https://github.com/megahomyak/sql_join_explanation) - I was struggling a lot when learning how `JOIN`s work in SQL, and when I finally got it (after two full days of trying to comprehend this simple concept), I decided to make a repository with a unique explanation of it, that would definitely help me if I saw it when reading about `JOIN`s.
* [toy_vm](https://github.com/megahomyak/toy_vm) - my toy VM written in C. Receives the bytecode and executes it.
* [tree_of_tasks](https://github.com/megahomyak/tree_of_tasks) - my school project: tasks list represented by a tree data structure. Definitely overcomplicated.

## I contributed in...

* [netschoolapi](https://github.com/nm17/netschoolapi) - asynchronous API client for "Ð¡ÐµÑ‚ÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð¹ Ð“Ð¾Ñ€Ð¾Ð´. ÐžÐ±Ñ€Ð°Ð·Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ðµ" (Russian educational platform (one of the worst, probably)) written in Python
